# ⚖️ Python Weight Converter

This is a basic Python program that converts weight between **kilograms** and **pounds** based on user input.

## 💡 Features

- Converts Kilograms to Pounds
- Converts Pounds to Kilograms
- Accepts user input with `K` or `L` (case-insensitive)

1. User enters weight (number).
2. User selects the unit (`K` for Kilograms or `L` for Pounds).
3. The program converts the weight and displays the result with two decimal places.
